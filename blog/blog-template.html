Reflection

At first it was a little uncomfortable to wireframe in a pair because neither of us had created a wireframe before and weren't sure where to start (plus we didn't know each other) . I was the driver so I tried to let him speak up and direct me as to what we wanted and where we wanted it. But he was great and still asked me if I agreed and about my opinion. We had some issues with the merge and pull on his side, but we worked well together and helped each other out the best we could. We both had different ways that we were used to setting up our HTML pages, but it was good because we got to compare our methods and talk about them. We were able to learn from each other and help each other out when the other was confused. Since we made a wireframe together, we got to use each other to ask questions and deal with early confusions with a partner.

I definitely found wireframing to be a helpful step to my development process. We decided to make a wireframe together instead of making our own wireframes so we could practice it together, but it helped show me how many different "right ways" there are to set up the layout of a website's index. We were able to play around with different types of icons and links to see what we liked and where we liked it. I was able to pretend as if I was the user and look at the wireframe to see how easy it was to use. Wireframing was great because we were able to play around with the text and layout as much as we wanted to and preview it, without having to put in the work yet of typing up the html code and changing it constantly. 

One of things we agreed on was that the more simple the layout the better, especially since neither of us had made a wireframe before. We also agreed that we needed a large title at the top of the page for users to know exactly what the page is about, as well as a subtitle to give further information. We also agreed that everything important should go across the top and the left-hand side, just based on how we as users look at websites and what made sense to us. Lastly, we both agreed to arrange the space with sections/boxes to make it look neat and organized.

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
I learned quite a few new semantics elements that I had not used before. I had never used <section> before, and my partner had so he taught me about this, that it defines a section of the page. I also learned about <header> to define the header of the page. I really wanted to include a search bar but I don't know how, so I googled it and got the code for it and pasted it in, so that is also one I learned - although I definitely have not memorized it yet or really know the details in the code yet.
