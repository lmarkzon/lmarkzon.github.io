      When I started Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp this week, there were so many fears going through my head: can I do this? what if everyone else knows more than me? what if it takes me longer than everyone else to learn? what if I fail? After watching Shereef's Fireside Chat (and 1 week into phase 0), I am happy to say I am feeling much more confident and excited than ever about DBC. Although I knew I wasn't alone or unique in having these thoughts and fears, I definitely did not realize that many students feel this way going into the program. I just assumed that I was one of the least experienced, but that's exactly who this program is for - beginners! I am going to feel lost and confused and make mistakes, and it's okay because so is everyone else and we'll all be able to help out one another. It sounds like pair programming is such a large portion of the program, which also makes me feel much better that we will be working with other people as well as more hands-on (opposed to just listening to lecture after lecture). I learn best through experience, such as trial and error, so DBC's teaching method ranks very high for me.

       Shereef discusses two mindsets he has seen both students and teachers shift into at DBC,  these are the Kitchen mindset and the Restaurant or Table mindset. The Table mindset is like walking into a restaurant and looking at the menu with a consumer mindset, you know exactly what you're getting so you expect to get what you paid for. A mindset of "if I feel I do not get what I paid for, I will complain because I'm owed this" as if everything we pay for should be handed to us. The other, more favorable, mindset is the Kitchen mindset; a handful of people are just learning to cook for the first time and others have some experience, but we're a team and can work it out together. He calls this being in "creator mode", and this, I believe, is key to thriving at Dev Bootcamp. My goal is to keep in mind the Kitchen mindset so I can be open to what the DBC experience has to offer and to let down some of those walls so I can really grow from the experience.

        What has pleasantly surprised me about DBC's learning environment and program is its focus on concepts besides just coding and technical details, such as researching better time-management skills and educating ourselves on our learning/thinking style for more efficient learning. When I was first looking into DBC's program I loved that they offered counseling and yoga during the onsite portion of the program, which definitely helped draw me in, but even in my first week of phase 0 I feel so much more aware of my learning abilities. I still have my fears for the program and know there are HUGE challenges ahead in the next few months, but now I am more excited about facing those challeneges than ever before. After all, we're all in this big "Kitchen" mess together.
