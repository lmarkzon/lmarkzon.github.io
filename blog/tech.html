        <h3>Web Security</h3>
          <h3 class="subheader">The Basics</h3>
            <p> 
              Based on what I know, one of the first and most important steps towards becoming a great web developer is understanding the fundamental basic principles of web/information security. Being familiar with security basics can help you understand the importance and role of security throughout the development lifecycle. If you don't avoid unncessarily unsecured software, you could be allowing "attackers" to exploit weaknesses for their own personal/financial gain and other malicious purposes. Protect you and your users from these kinds of issues by improving your practical knowledge of the basics of web security.

          <h3 class="subheader">Best Practices</h3>
            <p> 
              These are key things to consider for system security that apply to you no matter which general-purpose operating system you are using. You should always think about the following precautions when securing your systems against attackers and unauthorized access or unfortunate disasters. For more information of each of these far-too-common security issues on the web, check out the link at the bottom of the page!
            </p>
            <dl id="best-practices">
              <dt>Use strong passwords:</dt>
                <dd>
                  ONE of the simplest ways to improve security is to use a password that isn't easily guessed by brute force attacks. A brute force attack is one where the attacker uses an automated system to guess passwords as quickly as possible, hopefully finding the right password before long. Passwords that include special characters and spaces, use both capital and lowercase letters, avoid words in the dictionary, as well as numbers, are much more difficult to crack than your mother's name or your anniversary date. Remember as well that increasing the length of your password by one single character multiplies the total number of possibilities by the number of valid characters that can be used. In general, anything less than eight characters is considered far too easy to crack. Ten, 12, or even 16 is better. Just don't make it too long to remember or too difficult to type.
                </dd>
              <dt>Invest in good perimeter defense:</dt>
                <dd>
                   NOT all security occurs on the desktop. It's a good idea to use an external firewall/router to help protect your computer, even if you only have one computer. At the low end, you can purchase a retail router device, such as the commercial Linksys, D-Link, and Netgear routers that are available in stores such as Best Buy, Circuit City, and CompUSA. Higher up the scale, you can get managed switches, routers, and firewalls from "Enterprise" class vendors such as Cisco, Vyatta, and Foundry Networks. Starting somewhere in the middle and moving all the way up to direct competition with the major "Enterprise" class vendors, you can put together your own firewalls either "from scratch" or using prepackaged firewall/router installers such as m0n0wall and IPCop. Proxy servers, antivirus gateways, and spam filtering gateways can all contribute to stronger perimeter security as well. Remember that in general switches are better for security than hubs, routers with NAT are better than switches, and firewalls are a definite necessity.
                </dd>
              <dt>Update your software:</dt>
                <dd>
                  WHILE concerns such as patch testing before deployment to production systems may be of critical importance in many circumstances, ultimately security patches must be rolled out to your systems. Ignoring security updates for too long can result in the computers you use becoming easy targets for unscrupulous security crackers. Don't let the software installed on your computers fall too far behind the security update schedule. This also applies to any signature-based malware protection software such as antivirus applications (if your system needs them), which cannot be any more effective than the degree to which they are kept up to date with current malware signature definitions.
                </dd>
              <dt>Shut down services you don't use:</dt>
                <dd>
                  OFTEN, computer users don't even know which network accessible services are running on their systems. Make sure you're aware of every single service running on your computer, and have a reason for it to be running. This may require reading up on the importance of that service to your particular needs so that you don't make a mistake like shutting off the RPC service on a Microsoft Windows machine and disallow logging in, but it's always a good idea to have nothing running that you don't actually use.
                </dd>
              <dt>Employ a data encryption:</dt>
                <dd>
                  VARYING levels of data encryption coverage are available to the security-conscious computer user or sysadmin, and choosing the right level of encryption for your needs is something that must be decided based on circumstances. Data encryption can range from use of cryptographic tools on a file-by-file basis, through filesystem encryption, up to full disk encryption. Typically, this doesn't cover the boot partition, as that would require decryption assistance from specialized hardware, but if your need for privacy is great enough to justify the expense, it's possible to get such whole-system encryption. For anything short of boot partition encryption, there are a number of solutions available for each level of encryption desired, including both commercial proprietary systems and open source systems for full disk encryption on every major desktop operating system.
                </dd>
              <dt>Protect your data with backups:</dt>
                <dd>
                  ONE of the most important ways you can protect yourself from disaster is to back up your data. Strategies for data redundancy can range from something as simple and rudimentary as periodically saving copies to CD to complex, staggered, periodic automated backups to a server. Free backup tools such as rsync and Bacula are available for putting together automated backup schemes of arbitrary complexity. Version control systems such as Subversion can provide flexible data management so that you can not only have backups on another computer, but you can keep more than one desktop or laptop system up to date with the same data without a great deal of difficulty. 
                </dd>
              <dt>Encrypt sensitive communications:</dt>
                <dd>
                  CRYPTOGRAPHIC systems for protecting communications from eavesdroppers are surprisingly common. Software supporting OpenPGP for e-mail, the Off The Record plug-ins for IM clients, encrypted tunnel software for sustained communication using secure protocols such as SSH and SSL, and numerous other tools can be had easily to ensure that data is not compromised in transit. In person-to-person communications, of course, it can sometimes be difficult to convince the other participant to use encryption software to protect communications, but sometimes that protection is of critical importance.
                </dd>
              <dt>Don't trust foreign networks:</dt>
                <dd>
                THIS is really important on open wireless networks such as local businesses wifi networks. If you're careful and think about security, there's no reason you can't use a wireless network at a coffee shop or some other untrusted foreign network. The key is to ensure security through your own system, and don't trust the foreign network to be safe from malicious security hackers. For example, it is much more critical that you protect sensitive communications with encryption on an open wireless network, including when connecting to Web sites where you use a login session cookie to automate authentication or enter a username and password. Less obviously, make sure you don't have any network services running that are not strictly necessary, as they can be exploited if there is an unpatched vulnerability. Check your systems both from the inside and the outside to determine what opportunities malicious security crackers may have to attempt to compromise your computer, and make sure those points of entry are as locked down as reasonably possible.
                </dd>
              <dt>Get an uninterruptible power supply:</dt>
                <dd>
                  You want to make sure you get a power supply that works with your operating system to notify it when it needs to shut itself down, just in case you aren't there when the power goes out, and make sure you get a UPS that provides power conditioning as well as battery back-up. So it's not just important for won't lose files when the power goes out. A surge protector just isn't enough to protect your system against damage from "dirty" power. 
                </dd>
              <dt>Monitor systems for security threats and breaches:</dt>
                <dd>
                  You should always institute some kind of monitoring routine to make sure that suspicious behaviors come to your attention quickly and let you follow up on what security breaches or threats there might be to security. This kind of attention should be spent on both network monitoring and integrity auditing and/or other local system security monitoring techniques.
                </dd>
