      <h3>Ruby Classes</h3>
      <h3 class="subheader">Classes vs Objects</h3>
        <p> 
          As you may already know, Ruby is object-oriented and so everything in Ruby is an object. To understand what that really means, let's go over the difference between an object and a class. Classes define the behaviors of the objects in Ruby. A class is like a blueprint, once it's created you can use it to build as many "houses" as you'd like. An Object is an instance of a class, it has its own data and "knows" its class, including the behaviors that go with it. When objects are defined inside of a method, they are scoped to the method, and disappear when the method ends. For example, a string is a class and an object within that class could be the specific string "hello!".           
        </p>

        <h3 class="subheader">Instance and Class Variables</h3>
        <p> 
          Variables contain the data that's stored in objects. When variables are defined inside of a method, they are also scoped to the method. They come into existence brand new each time the method runs, and then disappears when the method ends. Instance Variables, prefixed with an @ symbol, and are scoped to the class. They can be accessed from any method within that class, and keep their value between method calls. Class Variables are tied to the class so there is only one total value, opposed to how Instance Variables have one for each and every instance/occurrence. Class variables are prefixed with two @ symbols instead of one, and are not as common as instance variables. To create an Instance Variable you can call a method on the class new, such as "string = String.new" (without quotes). Objects of most classes can be created by also calling new(). See both in action below and see the #comments for the line-by-line breakdown:
