      What are the benefits of version control? Well, version control is definitely helpful for keeping track of your own files, as well as when you are working on the same files with other people. So instead of sending a project back and forth to work on it remotely, we can all work on the same files at the same time without overwriting anything. It keeps track of your files and remembers any and all changes made to them, including who made them, and when. This is very helpful if you realize you've messed up your code and need to go back to a certain point and work from there. Version control is also great because it allows developers to share their projects with each other without affecting the original version.

        How does git help you keep track of changes? Git is an open-source version control system that allows developers to track changes made on their code files throughout the lifetime of a project. Git lets you create a "branch" where you work on some of the files without it affecting the base code or "trunk" until you are sure it is ready to be merged with the rest of the "tree". Whenever you want to "save" what you've done so far, you bundle up all of your changes into something called a commit. These are the "save check-points" that allow you to track your changes and go back to earlier versions of the project. A great part about Git is that it encourages developers to be experimental since you get to make changes locally and don't have to push to a centralized repository until you are ready.

        Why use GitHub to store your code? GitHub is a social coding website that allows developers to share their code, as well as keep track of changes to their work using Git. So by storing your code on GitHub, it is easily accessible to share with others, whether you want someone to review your work, contribute to projects, or you and 100 other people are working on a collaborative project. Or maybe another developer who is stuck somewhere in their coding might be able to learn or benefit from code that I've already written, or I might be the one who needs help! One of the best reasons to use GitHub to store your code is that since you're not "messing" with the master version of a file, you can be experimental and try different things before commiting a file. GitHub is so beneficial for developers to back-up, share, and track their work with other coders!
