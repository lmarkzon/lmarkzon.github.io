        <p>
        	Absolute is when the position of the element is literally exactly where you want it to be when placed, so it doesn't move regardless of what's surrounding it.
        </p>
        <p> 
        	Fixed is positioned relative to the browser window itself, so even the window is scrolled the position doesn't change.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Static means that the elements are not positioned in any special way, it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page. It is the default position.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Relative positioning means the element is relative to its normal self, meaning when you set the top, right, bottom, and left properties it will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position.
