    <h3>Women's Issues in the Tech Industry</h3>
    <p>
    What I found when researching was a lot of different issues, but there were two key issues that stood out at the “big ones”. The first is that there are not many women in the tech industry in the first place (or encouraged to be), and ironically, the second is that the few women that are working in the tech industry, are leaving at an alarming rate. According to the US Census Bureau, Women make up 59% of the US workforce, but the average percentage of women working in tech is only about 30%. And even that number isn’t really exact, since that’s just women who work for tech companies, when you get down to the stats of women in actual tech and leadership roles, it’s almost half of that. A quote in a LA times article I read on women in tech said “Last summer, Google, Facebook, Apple and other big tech companies released figures showing that men outnumbered women 4 to 1 or more in their technical sectors.” They also said that more than 50% of women will leave tech at some point in their careers, because of hostile working environments. Situations ranging from sexual harassment issues in the office, finding they have to prove themselves over and over again and otherwise given menial tasks they’re overqualified for, getting complaints about the way they “act” in the workplace, and I saw A LOT of “people treating me as if I had no idea what was going on”. They are things considered “small and silly” everyday issues that may not be complain-worthy, but when they are happening every single day repeatedly, they take a toll and make you question if “this is what I’m supposed to be doing”.

    Some steps have already been taken in the tech industry to help resolve some of these issues, and get more women attracted to and involved in tech. Programs such as Girls Who Code/Women Who Code and even Dev Bootcamp (offer a scholarship to women/minorities) are trying to make coding education and resources more available and accessible to women. But the key part of the problem isn’t getting more women interested in tech, in my opinion, it’s getting qualified women who are already in the tech industry to stay in it. One of the reasons women may be hesitant to have a career in the tech industry could be the reputation it has for “kicking women out” or not encouraging their career growth. The major companies, like I said before, are trying to hire more women and minorities, as well as make “systematic changes”, which is a good start. But something huge and “disruptive” needs to happen since this is a widespread issue that doesn’t only affect the tech industry and is not unique to any particular company or location, it’s happening consistently across national tech companies.

    This is all so interesting to me because when I started having an interest in tech and web development, all I heard was how the field is growing so quickly, that people in this industry were making great money, and that “being a woman” would be to my benefit since companies are hiring women/minorities left-and-right. Now that I know why all of these companies are so eager to hire women/minorities - it suddenly doesn’t feel as great being aware of all the issues it stems from.
