Reflection

<a href="http://lmarkzon.github.io">My Live Site</a>

	I learned that I prefer all of the padding to pretty much be 0, so everything is as close together as possible. I also learned that setting a margin on an item can help put it where you want it to go for the moment - but it can create all sorts of other issues later with other elements of the web page. It was super frustrating for me. The borders were pretty simple and I really enjoyed adding them to as many elements of my page as I could, it made it looks more organized and neat.

	In this challenge I learned a lot, but the biggest thing I learned was to take everything one step at a time. Do all of your fonts at once, do all of your color changes at once, add all of your images at once, and etc. I say this because there was so much to do throughout the site that I often forgot what I had did last or what I still needed to do, or what I did to cause an issue that affecting multiple elements. There were a couple times I found myself so deep in an error, that I had no idea what was causing it. I learned many hours later that it was a position issue with a random image. I also learned that relative, static, and absolute are my go-to positions, and that relative is in terms of the browser's "point of view".

	The easiest parts were the small details such as colors, fonts, text sizes, sending certain items to float in certain directions, things like that. The things I found extremely difficult, confusing, and time consuming were creating the navigation bar and having it look the way I wanted to. It was also very difficult for me to get the images the correct size. The most difficult aspect for me was really the positioning of the contents in the body without it affecting everything else I had already done.
