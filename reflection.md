- What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
	I learned that I prefer all of the padding to pretty much be 0, so everything is as close together as possible. 

- What did you learn about CSS positioning?
	In this challenge I learned a lot, but the biggest thing I learned was to take everything one step at a time. Do all of your fonts at once, do all of your color changes at once, add all of your images at once, and etc. I say this because there was so much to do throughout the site that I often forgot what I had did last or what I still needed to do, or what I did to cause an issue that affecting multiple elements. There were a couple times I found myself so deep in an error, that I had no idea what was causing it. I learned many hours later that it was a position issue with a random image. 

- What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?


- What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
