    <span class="bold">
    I was born and raised in...</span>West Bloomfield, MI, a township located in the Detroit Metropolitan Area. I recently moved from Michigan to Chicago, IL to dive head-first into the Web development industry, starting with furthering my education and experience by attending <a href="http://devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>(DBC).

  <p class="aboutme">
    <span class="bold"> After graduating...</span> from West Bloomfield High School, I went to college and graduated with a BA in Elementary Education from Michigan State University. Although I loved working with children, after I graduated I decided to explore other options besides teaching. For the next 3 years I worked as an office manager at a small business in my hometown, until I decided to apply for DBC!
