  <h3>Enumerable<span id="monospace">#group_by</span></h3>
    <p>
      The Enumerable is used in Ruby as a way of saying that we are able to get elements out of a data collection, one at a time. It is a module (like a container) used as a mixin, meaning it allows you to write code once and share it between a bunch of "mixed" classes, so you're able to put it in these containers to literally be "mixed in" with your classes. Enumerable provides a number of enumerators, which are tools that you can use to get each of the elements out of a collection in such a way like this. Having methods "return" enumerators allow us to "chain operations indefinitely" and make better collections. An example of one of these methods that make our code better is group_by.

      <span class="monospace">group_by</span> breaks a data collection into groups depending on the given parameters or criteria, by result of the block (see above). It expects a block containing the criteria of how the items in the collection are supposed to be grouped, and returns a hash where each key represents a group. Each of the key's paired value is an array that contains the objects that belong to that group. If no block is given - an enumerator is returned. When used on an array, this method iterates (points to each item within the array and tells it what to do, over and over...) through the array, passing each element to the block. The resulting value of the block is the group that the element is supposed to be placed in. When used on a hash, this method passes each of the key-value pairs in the hash to the block, as either a two-element array or two separate items.

      In the block of code below, 0 - 15 are passed to the block that receives each of the numbers as the criteria (or parameter) <span class="monospace">number</span>. The result value of the block <span class="monospace">number % 3</span> determines which group (array) each number is going to placed into, this result could be 0, 1, or 2. Meaning the resulting hash will have 3 groups represented by those keys (0, 1, or 2), all containing different things based on the key's corresponding value.
