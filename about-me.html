    	<p class="aboutme">
    		<span class="bold"> I was born and raised in...</span>West Bloomfield, MI, a township located in the Detroit Metropolitan Area (click the mitten below). I recently moved from Michigan to Chicago, IL to dive head-first into the Web development industry, starting with furthering my education and experience by attending <a href="http://devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>(DBC).

      <p class="aboutme">
        <span class="bold"> After graduating...</span> from West Bloomfield High School, I went to college and graduated with a BA in Elementary Education from Michigan State University. Although I loved working with children, after I graduated I decided to explore other options besides teaching. Around this time, the owner of the dance studio I attended growing up contacted me about opening a second location and needed an office manager. I happily accepted the position, the business grew tremendously, and I ended up working there for the next 3 years, until I decided to apply for DBC!

      <p class="aboutme">
        <span class="bold"> When I'm not working...</span> on web development, I spend my time doing a multitude of different things. As you read above, I got my job at the studio because the owner was my teacher growing up. I began dancing (jazz, ballet, etc) when I was 5 years old and the rest is history. I also love to travel, I think living in new places and learning about different cultures and their history is amazing. Above anything else, I love spending time with my friends and family, especially my adorable troublemaking niece (soon to be nieces!!).
