    		<span class="bold"> I was born and raised in...</span>West Bloomfield, MI, a township located in the Detroit Metropolitan Area (click the mitten below). But I recently moved from Michigan to Chicago, IL to dive head-first into the Web development industry, starting with furthering my education and experience by attending <a href="http://devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>(DBC). I decided to apply for the DBC program while I was working as an office manager at a dance studio in Michigan. A part of my responsibilities included updating and maintaining the business website, office systems, and business social media accounts, which eventually sparked my interests in Web Development.

      <p class="aboutme">
        <span class="bold"> When I'm not working...</span> on web development which lately is not that often, I spend my time doing a multitude of different things. As you could assume from reading above, I got my job at a dance studio because I was a dancer and the owner was my teacher growing up. I began dancing (jazz, ballet, etc) when I was 5 years old and the rest is history. I danced competitively through my dance studio, my high school's dance team, and was even on my college's dance team for a bit. Besides dance, I enjoy researching and experimenting with different recipes, if I'm cooking for a group during the holidays or just myself during the week - it relaxes me. In addition to cooking, I love to travel, whether I'm going somewhere in the states or to a country on the other side of the world. I love going to places I've never been before and learning about their culture and history, I find it just fascinating. But above anything else, I love spending time with my friends and family, especially my adorable troublemaker niece (soon to be nieces!!).

      <p class="aboutme">
        <span class="bold"> After graduating in...</span> 2007 from West Bloomfield High School, I went to college and majored in Elementary Education with emphases in Social Studies and Geography. Growing up I worked with children all the time, at summer camp, at dance, and I was great at it - so I never questioned whether or not teaching was right for me. Once I graduated from Michigan State University in 2012 with a BA in Elementary Education, I started having mixed feelings about teaching but wasn't sure what I wanted to do instead. Luckily, my old dance teacher decided to open a second location of her studio and needed an office manager. When she contacted me I happily accepted the position, the business grew tremendously, and I ended up working there for the next 3 years, and again, this is where I started growing an interest in web development.
