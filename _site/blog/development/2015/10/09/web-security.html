      <h3 class="subheader">The Basics</h3>
        <p>
          Based on what I know, one of the first and most important steps towards becoming a great web developer is understanding the fundamental basic principles of web/information security. Being familiar with security basics can help you understand the importance and role of security throughout the development lifecycle. If you don't avoid unncessarily unsecured software, you could be allowing "attackers" to exploit weaknesses for their own personal/financial gain and other malicious purposes. Protect you and your users from these kinds of issues by improving your practical knowledge of the basics of web security.
        </p>
      <h3 class="subheader2">Best Practices</h3>
        <p>
          These are key things to consider for system security that apply to you no matter which general-purpose operating system you are using. You should always think about the following precautions when securing your systems against attackers and unauthorized access or unfortunate disasters. For more information of each of these far-too-common security issues on the web, check out the link at the bottom of the page!
        </p>
        <div class="best-practices">
        <dl>
          <dt>Use strong passwords:</dt>
            <dd>
              One of the most basic ways to improve security is to utilize passwords that aren't easily guessed by brute force attacks. A brute force attack is when the attacker uses an automated system to guess passwords as quickly as possible, hoping to find the correct password. Passwords that have special characters and spaces in them, use both capital and lowercase letters, avoid words in the dictionary, as well as numbers, are much more difficult to crack than your middle name or your birth date. Remember as well that increasing the length of your password by just one character multiplies the total number of possibilities by the number of valid characters that can be used. In general, anything less than eight characters is considered far too easy to crack, the longer the better!
            </dd>
          <dt>Invest in good perimeter defense:</dt>
            <dd>
               Since not all security occurs on the desktop, it's a good idea to use an external firewall/router to help protect your computer. At the low end, you can purchase a retail router device. On the higher end, you can get managed switches, routers, and firewalls from "Enterprise" class vendors. Starting somewhere in the middle and moving all the way up to direct competition with the major "Enterprise" class vendors, you can put together your own firewalls either "from scratch" or using prepackaged firewall/router installers. Proxy servers, antivirus gateways, and spam filtering gateways can all improve perimeter security as well. In general, switches are better for security than hubs, routers with NAT are better than switches, and firewalls are a necessity.
            </dd>
          <dt>Update your software:</dt>
            <dd>
              While concerns such as patch testing before deployment to production systems may be very important in many situations, ultimately security patches must be rolled out to your systems. Ignoring security updates for a long time can result in the computer becoming easy targets for shady security crackers. Don't let your computer software fall too far behind the security update schedule.
            </dd>
          <dt>Shut down services you don't use:</dt>
            <dd>
              Often times, computer users don't even know which network accessible services are running on their systems. Make sure you're aware of every service running on your computer, and have a reason for it to still be running. This might require researching the importance of that service to your particular needs so you don't make a mistake, but it's always a good idea to have nothing running that you don't actually use.
            </dd>
          <dt>Employ a data encryption:</dt>
            <dd>
              Different levels of data encryption coverage are available to the security-conscious computer user, and choosing the right level of encryption for your particular needs is something that must be decided based on circumstances. Data encryption ranges from use of cryptographic tools on a file-by-file basis, through filesystem encryption, up to full disk encryption. This doesn't usually cover the boot partition, as that would require decryption assistance from specialized hardware. If your need for privacy is great enough to justify the purchase, it's definitely possible to get such whole-system encryption. For anything short of boot partition encryption, there are many solutions available for each level of encryption you need, this includes both commercial proprietary systems and open source systems for full disk encryption on every major desktop operating system.
            </dd>
          <dt>Protect your data with backups:</dt>
            <dd>
              One of the most important ways you can protect yourself from disaster is to back up your data on your system. Strategies for data redundancy can range from something as easy as periodically saving copies to CD to complex, staggered, periodic automated backups to a server. Free backup tools are available for putting together automated backup schemes of arbitrary complexity. Version control systems can provide flexible data management so that you can not only have backups on another computer. Although you can keep more than one desktop or laptop system up to date with the same data without a great deal of difficulty.
            </dd>
          <dt>Encrypt sensitive communications:</dt>
            <dd>
              Cryptographic systems for protecting communications from these eavesdroppers are surprisingly very common. Software supporting OpenPGP for e-mail, the Off The Record plug-ins for IM clients, encrypted tunnel software for sustained communication using secure protocols like SSH and SSL, and many other tools can be used to easily ensure that data is not compromised in transit. Of course in person-to-person communications, it can be difficult to convince the other user to utilize encryption software to protect communications, but sometimes that protection is critical!
            </dd>
          <dt>Don't trust foreign networks:</dt>
            <dd>
              It's really important to not trust foreign networks on open wireless networks such as local businesses wifi networks. If you're careful and think about security, there's no reason you can't use a wireless network at a coffee shop or some other untrusted foreign network. The key is to ensure security through your own system, and don't trust the foreign network to be safe from malicious security hackers. For example, it's much more critical that you protect sensitive communications with encryption on an open wireless network, including when you connect to Web sites where you use a login session cookie to automate authentication or enter a username and password. Less obviously, make sure you don't have any network services running that are not completely necessary, as they can be exploited if there is an unpatched vulnerability. Check your systems from both the inside and outside to determine what cracks malicious security hackers may see to try to compromise your computer, and make sure those points of entry are as locked down as reasonably possible!
            </dd>
          <dt>Get an uninterruptible power supply:</dt>
            <dd>
              You want to make sure you get a power supply that works with your operating system to notify it when it needs to shut itself down, just in case you aren't there when the power goes out, and make sure you get a UPS that provides power conditioning as well as battery back-up. So it's not just important for won't lose files when the power goes out. A surge protector just isn't enough to protect your system against damage from "dirty" power.
            </dd>
          <dt>Monitor systems for security threats and breaches:</dt>
            <dd>
              You should always institute some kind of monitoring routine to make sure that suspicious behaviors come to your attention quickly and let you follow up on what security breaches or threats there might be to security. This kind of attention should be spent on both network monitoring and integrity auditing and/or other local system security monitoring techniques.
